# ROUND A

## Training

As the football coach at your local school, you have been tasked with picking a team of exactly P students to represent your school. There are N students for you to pick from. The i-th student has a skill rating Si, which is a positive integer indicating how skilled they are.

You have decided that a team is fair if it has exactly P students on it and they all have the same skill rating. That way, everyone plays as a team. Initially, it might not be possible to pick a fair team, so you will give some of the students one-on-one coaching. It takes one hour of coaching to increase the skill rating of any student by 1.

The competition season is starting very soon (in fact, the first match has already started!), so you'd like to find the minimum number of hours of coaching you need to give before you are able to pick a fair team.

## Parcels

You have been hired recently as the Chief Decision Maker (CDM) at a famous parcel delivery company, congratulations! Customers love speedy deliveries of their parcels and you have decided to decrease the time it takes to deliver parcels around the world to win customers. You have introduced this idea to the authorities and they have allocated you enough budget to build at most one new delivery office.

The world can be divided into an R Ã— C grid of squares. Each square either contains a delivery office or it does not. You may pick a grid square that does not already contain a delivery office and build a new delivery office there.

The delivery time of a parcel to a square is 0 if that square contains a delivery office. Otherwise, it is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance between that square and any other square containing a delivery office. The overall delivery time is the maximum of delivery times of all the squares. What is the minimum overall delivery time you can obtain by building at most one new delivery office?

Note: The Manhattan distance between two squares (r1,c1) and (r2,c2) is defined as |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|, where |\*| operator denotes the absolute value.
